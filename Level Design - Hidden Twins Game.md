## Level Overview

| Level | Grid Size | Total Cards | Difficulty | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1     | 4x4       | 16         | Medium     | Cards appear in a **random order** each game to increase replayability and challenge memory skills |


---

## Grid Layouts
- **4x4:** Medium challenge with **randomized card positions**.  
---

## Difficulty Settings 
- **Medium:** Standard flip-back delay, randomized 4x4 layout, moderate time bonus.  

---

## Design Notes
- Each level should be visually consistent (card size, spacing).  
- Grid layout must scale correctly for different screen resolutions.  
- **Randomized card order:** For the 4x4 medium level, the position of each card is shuffled at the start of every game to make memorization more challenging.   
- Time-based scoring should scale with difficulty (harder levels = higher potential score).  

---

## Future Ideas
- Addition of other difficulties with different number of cards.
- Special levels with unique themes or card designs.  
- Timed challenges with countdown.  
- Bonus points for consecutive matches without mistakes.
